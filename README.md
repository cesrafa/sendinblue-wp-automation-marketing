# Sendinblue Automation Marketing for WordPress - A personal guide and notes

Sendinblue is a solution for email automation and marketing. It turns out to be a good system that you can integrate to your company's email system. In that sense, it can help you all types of scenarios for your emails.

Sendinblue provides a WordPress plugin, but even though it fills all basic requirements for non-programmers, like quick and easy integration with your credentials and statistic management, it lacks of an easy way to develop advanced situations for your email system, specifically if you want to use Events, Scenarios and Marketing Automation. Even if you can find good reference in Sendinblue's docs, Automation Tracker API misses some details for programmers, at least when you try to code for server side features.

The motivation for this repository is to provide a simple way to start using Marketing Automation in server side code for WordPress, by using cURL, PHP syntax and some examples of how you need to provide data in order to use it on email templates you assign to certain scenarios, triggered by events.

## Getting Started

You can use all of this in PHP, even if I first started this development for WordPress. Actually, I provide here code that can be adapted to be used on PHP only.

You need to make sure to have cURL installed.
